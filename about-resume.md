## Hi, I'm Cem Yasan

I am a **Senior Game Developer** with over 10 years of professional experience, primarily focused on Unity3D development for mobile and VR platforms. My expertise covers the full software development lifecycle, from designing rapid prototypes to managing live operations and technical architecture.

**Mobile Game Development & Leadership.** Most recently, I served as a Senior Game Developer at Udo Games (until July 2025). In this role, I acted as the Project Development Lead for the hybrid-casual RPG *"Space Heroes: Epic Galaxy RPG"*, managing the technical development and later overseeing the product roadmap as a Product Manager. I concluded my tenure at Udo Games to dedicate myself to completing my Master's thesis. Prior to this, as a Partner at Soup Games, I established efficient 2-week development pipelines to create and test hyper-casual prototypes for major publishers.

**VR & Serious Games.** My technical background extends deeply into XR. At DancingMind Therapeutics (Singapore), I worked remotely as a VR Developer, leading the creation of serious games designed to assist patients with dementia and stroke recovery. I also have extensive experience delivering B2B XR projects and commercial VR titles, such as *"Header Goal VR"*, released on Steam and Oculus Store, developed during my time at Codemodeon and Flamingo Game Studio.

**Academic & Educational Contributions.** In addition to my industry work, I served as a Part-time Lecturer at Istanbul Bilgi University, where I taught mobile and VR game development practices to Digital Game Design students. I am currently solidifying my practical experience with academic research, completing my *Master's degree* in *Game Design* with a thesis focused on *playability heuristics in hyper-casual games*.
