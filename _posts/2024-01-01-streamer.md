**Studio:** Udo Games<br>
**Team Size:** 8 (Developers, Artists, Designers)<br>
**Store Page:** <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udogames.streamermerge" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>

Streamer Life Sim is a mobile life-sim with character customization, NPC-driven interactions, an item economy, and a home decoration loop. My focus was building scalable systems and pipelines that support frequent iteration and large content volumes.

## My Role
- Owned multiple interconnected systems end-to-end, including **store, home decoration, character customization, NPC interactions, and minigames**.
- Designed **data-driven and live-ops–friendly architectures** using ScriptableObjects, stable IDs, and Unity Addressables.
- Implemented **remote content delivery workflows**, enabling game content (items, customization assets, decorations) to be **updated from a server without requiring client rebuilds**.
- Built internal **editor tooling and automation** to scale content production and reduce manual, error-prone workflows for designers and artists.
- Took responsibility for **production stability** in high-risk areas such as save/load, persistent state restoration, and live content updates.
- Made architectural decisions with **long-term maintainability, backward compatibility, and live iteration** in mind.

## Addressables & Content Delivery
- Implemented and maintained Unity Addressables to support remote content updates from a server without requiring full client rebuilds.
- Designed asset grouping and addressable settings to enable live content updates for large item libraries (store items, customization assets, decoration content).
- Integrated runtime loading patterns to ensure content could be added, updated, or disabled remotely while keeping client logic stable.
- Improved asset organization to reduce update risk, manage memory usage, and avoid breaking references during live updates.

## Store & Monetization Systems
- Store flow architecture (spawn/display logic, purchase flows, bundles, unlock states)
- UX improvements (preview/zoom, panel iterations, edge-case handling)
- Analytics hooks for monetization observability (rewarded / events)

## Live-Ops Content Pipeline (Addressables × Store × Customization)
A key responsibility of my role was ensuring that **store content, customization assets, and decoration items** could be updated safely and efficiently as part of a **live-ops pipeline**.

### How the pipeline worked (client-side)
- **Addressables** were used to decouple content from the app binary, allowing assets to be delivered and updated remotely from a server.
- **Store systems** consumed addressable-backed item data to dynamically populate:
  - Available items
  - Bundles and promotions
  - Unlock and purchase states
- **Character customization and home decoration systems** referenced the same stable IDs and data structures, ensuring:
  - Newly delivered items appeared automatically
  - Existing saves remained valid
  - Removed or disabled content failed gracefully

### My responsibilities in this pipeline
- Defined **stable ID strategies** so content updates would not invalidate saves or break references.
- Organized addressable groups and loading boundaries to balance **memory usage, update size, and runtime safety**.
- Ensured store UI, customization previews, and placement systems handled **missing, delayed, or updated content** robustly.
- Coordinated logic so content changes could be shipped independently of code changes, reducing release pressure.

## Home Decoration & Placement + Persistence
- Grid-based placement rules & edit-mode interactions
- Wall/floor constraints and placement validation feedback
- House save/load restoration of decorated states across sessions

## Tooling & Content Pipeline Automation
- Editor tooling to automate:
  - Placeable item prefab creation
  - ScriptableObject + ID generation
  - Batch content setup for large item sets
- Reusable UI tween controller to standardize transitions across panels

## Character Customization Systems
- Customization UI/UX (panels, preview, rotation)
- Data integration with item libraries and store/unlock flows
- Scaling item libraries while keeping structure maintainable

## NPC Conversations & Narrative Interactions
- Condition-driven conversation system (IDs, branching choices/outcomes, progress saving)
- Interaction gating based on relationship/progress state
- Large-scale content reorganization support without breaking narrative state
